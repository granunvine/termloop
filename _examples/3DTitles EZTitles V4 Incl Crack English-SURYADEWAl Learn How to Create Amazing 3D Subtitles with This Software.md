Padmaavat 2 is a rumored sequel to the 2018 blockbuster Padmaavat, directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and starring Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor. The film was based on the epic poem Padmavat by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, which narrates the story of Queen Padmavati of Chittor, who committed self-immolation along with other women to protect their honor from the invading Sultan Alauddin Khilji.
 
While there is no official confirmation about Padmaavat 2, some fans have speculated that the sequel might explore the aftermath of Padmavati's sacrifice and the fate of her husband Ratan Singh and Khilji. Some have also suggested that the sequel might introduce new characters and subplots from the original poem, such as Padmavati's friendship with Hiraman parrot, Khilji's rivalry with his nephew and son-in-law Malik Kafur, and Ratan Singh's alliance with Gora and Badal, two brave warriors of Chittor.

However, there is no evidence that Bhansali or the cast are working on Padmaavat 2, and it is unlikely that the film will be made anytime soon. Padmaavat faced a lot of controversy and protests from various groups who accused the film of distorting history and hurting the sentiments of Rajputs. The film was banned in several states and faced violent threats from fringe elements. The film also had to undergo several cuts and modifications by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) before getting a release certificate.
 
Therefore, Padmaavat 2 might not be a feasible project for Bhansali or the actors, who might not want to repeat the ordeal they faced for Padmaavat. Moreover, Padmaavat was a complete story in itself, and did not leave any scope for a sequel. The film ended with a powerful climax that showed Padmavati leading the women of Chittor to their fiery death, while Ratan Singh and Khilji fought on the battlefield. The film also had a voice-over narration that stated that Khilji's conquest of Chittor was futile, as he could never capture Padmavati's beauty or spirit.
