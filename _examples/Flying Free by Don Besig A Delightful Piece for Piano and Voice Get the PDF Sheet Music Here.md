## What is Flying Free About?
 
The song **Flying Free** is based on a poem by Douglas E. Wagner, who collaborated with Don Besig on many occasions. The poem expresses the joy of flying free from the troubles and worries of life, and finding peace and happiness in nature. The poem also uses metaphors of birds and wings to symbolize freedom and aspiration.
 
Here are some of the lyrics of the song:

> I saw a bird soar high above the trees
 And wished that I could fly that way
 But I have no wings to lift me from the ground
 And so I watch him fly away
> 
> 
> But then I close my eyes and feel the wind
 And soon I'm soaring through the air
 I have no wings but still I can fly free
 For in my dreams I'm flying there
