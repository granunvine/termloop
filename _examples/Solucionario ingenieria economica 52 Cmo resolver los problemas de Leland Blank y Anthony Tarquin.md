You can import and export 3D models, synchronize design changes, and resolve conflicts between electrical and mechanical domains. Note: for Siemens NX integration, you need to have an Altium Enterprise subscription.

Bi-directional co-design is a powerful feature that enables you to work more efficiently and avoid costly errors in your PCB design process. By integrating your ECAD and MCAD tools, you can ensure that your design meets both electrical and mechanical requirements, and that any changes are synchronized across both domains. This way, you can avoid issues such as component collisions, board shape mismatches, or incorrect placement of mounting holes.
  
Altium Designer supports bi-directional co-design with major MCAD software platforms: SOLIDWORKS, PTC Creo, Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Fusion 360, Siemens NX. You can import and export 3D models, synchronize design changes, and resolve conflicts between electrical and mechanical domains. Note: for Siemens NX integration, you need to have an Altium Enterprise subscription.
  
To use bi-directional co-design with Altium Designer, you need to install the corresponding MCAD CoDesigner extension for your MCAD software. You can find the extensions on the Altium website or in the Altium Content Vault. Once installed, you can use the CoDesigner panel in Altium Designer to initiate the co-design workflow. You can also use the CoDesigner panel in your MCAD software to access the same features.

The co-design workflow with Altium Designer and MCAD software is simple and intuitive. You can start by creating a PCB project in Altium Designer and importing a 3D model of the board shape from your MCAD software. Alternatively, you can create a PCB project in your MCAD software and export it to Altium Designer. You can then place components, route traces, and define design rules in Altium Designer. You can also use the 3D view to check the mechanical fit of your design.
  
When you need to update your design in either domain, you can use the CoDesigner panel to push or pull changes. You can choose which changes to accept or reject, and see the impact of the changes on both domains. You can also use the CoDesigner panel to compare versions, add comments, and resolve conflicts. The CoDesigner panel keeps track of the co-design history and shows you the status of your design at any time.
  
By using bi-directional co-design with Altium Designer and MCAD software, you can save time and money, improve design quality, and enhance collaboration. You can eliminate the need for manual file transfers, reduce errors and rework, and ensure that your design meets both electrical and mechanical specifications. You can also communicate more effectively with your MCAD colleagues and stakeholders, and deliver your design faster and easier.
