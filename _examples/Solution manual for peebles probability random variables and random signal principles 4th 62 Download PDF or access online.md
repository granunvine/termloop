Probability theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of random phenomena. It is used to model and quantify the uncertainty and variability in real-world situations. Probability theory provides the tools to calculate the likelihood of different outcomes and events, as well as to measure the degree of dependence or independence between them.
 
Random variables are quantities that can take on different values depending on the outcome of a random experiment. For example, the number of heads obtained when tossing a coin three times is a random variable. Random variables can be classified into discrete or continuous types, depending on whether they have a finite or infinite number of possible values. Discrete random variables can be represented by probability mass functions, while continuous random variables can be represented by probability density functions.
 
Random signal principles are the concepts and methods that apply to the analysis and processing of signals that contain randomness or noise. Signals are functions that convey information through variations in some physical quantity, such as voltage, sound, or light. Random signals are signals whose values are not completely predictable or deterministic, but depend on some random factors. Random signal principles include topics such as autocorrelation, cross-correlation, power spectrum, Fourier transform, linear systems, filtering, and sampling.

Some examples of random signals are the noise in a radio receiver, the fluctuations in the stock market, the speech signals in a telephone conversation, and the temperature variations in a room. These signals are random because they are affected by various sources of uncertainty and interference that cannot be controlled or predicted. Random signals can be modeled as functions of random variables or random processes.
 
The autocorrelation of a signal is a measure of how similar the signal is to itself at different time shifts. It is defined as the expected value of the product of the signal and a delayed version of itself. The autocorrelation function can be used to characterize the statistical properties of a random signal, such as its mean, variance, and periodicity. The autocorrelation function can also be used to estimate the power spectrum of a signal, which shows how the signal's energy is distributed over different frequencies.
 
The applications of random signal principles are numerous and diverse. They include communication systems, signal processing, control systems, cryptography, image processing, radar, sonar, biomedical engineering, and many more. Random signal principles enable engineers to design systems that can transmit, receive, filter, compress, encrypt, and analyze signals that contain randomness or noise. Random signal principles also help engineers to evaluate the performance and reliability of such systems.
