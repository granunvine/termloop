## Don Bosco's Miracles: Signs of God's Love and Power
 
Don Bosco was not only a great educator and a founder of a religious order, but also a miracle worker. He performed many signs and wonders that attested to his holiness and his connection with God. Some of his miracles were related to his devotion to Mary, whom he called the Help of Christians. Others were manifestations of his gifts of prophecy, healing, bilocation, and multiplication.
 
One of the most famous miracles of Don Bosco was the healing of Maria Stardero, a blind girl who regained her sight after Don Bosco prayed for her and gave her a medal of Mary Help of Christians[^1^] [^2^]. This miracle took place in 1870, in the church that Don Bosco built in honor of Mary in Turin. Many witnesses saw how the girl's eyes, which had no corneas and looked like white marbles, suddenly became normal and able to see. The girl was overjoyed and ran home to tell her family and friends. She never lost her vision again and lived until 1916.
 
Another miracle that Don Bosco performed was the multiplication of hosts during Mass. This happened several times when Don Bosco had more communicants than hosts. He would pray to Mary and then break the hosts into smaller pieces, which would multiply in his hands until everyone received Holy Communion[^3^]. One of these occasions was in 1871, when Don Bosco celebrated Mass for 360 boys at Lanzo, but he only had 40 hosts. His altar server, Giuseppe Buzzetti, who later became a Salesian priest, witnessed how Don Bosco distributed the hosts without running out[^4^].
 
Don Bosco also had the gift of prophecy, which he used to guide and warn his boys and benefactors. He often had dreams that revealed the future or the spiritual state of his sons. He would tell them his dreams and advise them on how to avoid dangers or improve their lives. He also predicted events that affected the Church and the world, such as the First Vatican Council, the unification of Italy, the Franco-Prussian War, and the death of Pope Pius IX[^3^].
 
Don Bosco also healed many people who were sick or injured, either by touching them, blessing them, or sending them relics or medals. He cured people of fever, tuberculosis, epilepsy, paralysis, cancer, and other diseases[^3^]. He also saved people from accidents or attacks by invoking Mary's protection or by appearing to them in bilocation[^3^]. He once saved a boy who fell from a roof by catching him in mid-air[^3^]. He also rescued a boy who was attacked by a wolf by appearing to him and scaring away the animal[^3^].
 
Don Bosco's miracles were not meant to draw attention to himself, but to God and Mary. He always gave glory to God and thanked Mary for their intervention. He also used his miracles as opportunities to teach his boys and others about the faith and the importance of living a virtuous life. He said that miracles are signs of God's love and power, but they are not enough to make us saints. We need to cooperate with God's grace and follow his commandments.
