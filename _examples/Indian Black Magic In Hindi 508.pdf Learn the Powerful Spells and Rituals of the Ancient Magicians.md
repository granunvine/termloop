India has a long and rich history of black magic, especially in some regions like Mayong, Assam, where it is said that witchcraft has been practiced for centuries. According to legend, in 1337, Muhammad Shahâs army of 100,000 horsemen perished at the hands of witchcraft in a location near Mayong[^2^]. Many locals believe that black magic is still prevalent in the area and that some people possess secret books and manuscripts that contain spells and rituals for various purposes.
 
Black magic in Hindi is also known as kala ilm or kala jadoo. It is said that black magic can be performed by using various methods, such as chanting mantras, invoking spirits, using dolls or puppets, writing symbols or diagrams on paper or cloth, or using herbs or animal parts. Some of the common reasons for performing black magic are to harm an enemy, to attract love, to gain wealth or power, to cure diseases, or to seek revenge.
 
However, black magic is not without risks and consequences. Many people believe that black magic can backfire on the practitioner or cause negative karma. It is also considered a sin and a crime in many religions and cultures. In India, there are laws against practicing witchcraft or harming others by using black magic. Those who are accused of being involved in black magic may face social stigma, discrimination, violence, or even death.
 
Therefore, black magic in Hindi is a mysterious and dangerous practice that should be avoided by anyone who values their life and soul. It is better to seek positive and ethical ways of achieving one's goals and solving one's problems than to resort to dark and evil forces.
  
Black magic in Hindi is often influenced by various cultural and religious traditions, such as Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and tribal beliefs. Some of the sources of black magic knowledge are ancient scriptures, such as the Atharva Veda, the Tantra Shastra, and the Quran. Some of the practitioners of black magic are known as tantriks, aghoris, jadugars, or ojhas. They may claim to have supernatural abilities or connections with spirits or deities.
