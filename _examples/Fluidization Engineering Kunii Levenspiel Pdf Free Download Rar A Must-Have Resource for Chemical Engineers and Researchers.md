# Fluidization Engineering by Kunii and Levenspiel: A Comprehensive Guide for Engineers
 
Fluidization engineering is the branch of chemical engineering that deals with the design and operation of fluidized bed reactors, which are widely used in various industrial processes such as combustion, gasification, catalysis, drying, coating, and granulation. Fluidized bed reactors offer many advantages over conventional fixed-bed or packed-bed reactors, such as high heat and mass transfer rates, uniform temperature and concentration profiles, low pressure drop, and easy scale-up.
 
However, fluidization engineering also poses many challenges and complexities, such as multiphase flow dynamics, bubble behavior, entrainment and elutriation, mixing and segregation, heat and mass transfer limitations, and reactor stability and control. To master these challenges and complexities, engineers need a solid understanding of the fundamental principles and practical applications of fluidization engineering.

One of the most authoritative and comprehensive books on fluidization engineering is *Fluidization Engineering* by Daizo Kunii and Octave Levenspiel. First published in 1969 and revised in 1991, this book covers the recent advances in the field of fluidization engineering and presents the studies of developments necessary to the engineers, designers, and users of fluidized beds. The book is divided into 17 chapters that cover topics such as:
 
- Industrial applications of fluidized beds
- Fluidization and mapping of regimes
- The dense bed: distributors, gas jets, and pumping power
- Bubbles in dense beds
- Bubbling fluidized beds
- Entrainment and elutriation from fluidized beds
- High-velocity fluidization
- Solid movement: mixing, segregation, and staging
- Gas dispersion and gas interchange in bubbling beds
- Particle-to-gas mass and heat transfer
- Conversion of gas in catalytic reactions
- Heat transfer between fluidized beds and surfaces
- The RTD and size distribution of solids in fluidized beds
- Circulation systems
- Design for physical operations
- Design of catalytic reactors
- The design of noncatalytic gas-solid reactors

The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous examples, problems, figures, tables, and references. It is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate students who want to learn the basics of fluidization engineering, as well as for practicing engineers who want to update their knowledge and skills in this field.
