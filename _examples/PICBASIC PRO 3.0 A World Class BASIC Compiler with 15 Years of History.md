## How to Get Started with PICBASIC PRO 3.0
 
If you want to try PICBASIC PRO 3.0 for yourself, you can download a free trial version from the official website[^1^]. The trial version will function for 15 days and will let you compile code for any supported PIC device. You will also need to download and install MPLABX from Microchip[^2^] to program your PIC microcontroller.
 
If you decide to purchase PICBASIC PRO 3.0, you can choose from three editions: Silver, Gold, or Platinum. Each edition has different features and limitations, such as the number of supported devices, the maximum program size, and the availability of technical support. You can compare the editions and their prices on the website[^1^]. Once you purchase an edition, you will receive an activation key that will unlock the full functionality of the compiler.
