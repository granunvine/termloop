The Moody Atlas of Bible Lands is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of the biblical world and its relevance for today. It provides a visual and textual guide to the places, events, and people that shaped the history of salvation.

The atlas is divided into two main parts: the physical geography of the land and the historical geography of the land.

The second part traces the history of God's people from the patriarchs to the early church, highlighting the key events, movements, and empires that influenced their faith and destiny.
 
Each map is accompanied by explanatory notes that describe the geographical features, historical background, archaeological discoveries, and biblical references related to each location. The maps are also color-coded to indicate different periods, regions, routes, and boundaries. The atlas also features several thematic maps that illustrate topics such as trade, warfare, agriculture, religion, and prophecy.
