Motion blur is a visual effect that simulates the blurring of moving objects in a scene. It can make your videos look more realistic, dynamic and cinematic. However, not all cameras or video editing software can capture or create motion blur natively. That's where After Effects CC and RSMB (ReelSmart Motion Blur) come in handy.
 
After Effects CC is a powerful video editing and compositing software that can create stunning visual effects and animations. RSMB is a plug-in for After Effects CC that applies natural-looking motion blur by automatically tracking every pixel in your footage. It can also use motion vectors supplied by your 3D system to blur with more accuracy and control.

- Motion blur can make your videos look more natural and smooth. It can reduce the stuttering or juddering effect that occurs when fast-moving objects appear to jump from one frame to another. Motion blur can also hide the low frame rate or resolution of your footage.
- Motion blur can create a sense of speed and movement. It can emphasize the direction and intensity of the motion in your scene. Motion blur can also convey the mood and emotion of your video, such as excitement, urgency, or drama.
- Motion blur can add depth and dimension to your videos. It can create a shallow depth of field effect that separates the foreground from the background. Motion blur can also simulate the motion parallax effect that occurs when objects closer to the camera move faster than objects farther away.

## When Not to Use Motion Blur in Your Videos?
 
While motion blur can be beneficial for your videos, it can also have some drawbacks or limitations. Here are some situations when you should not use motion blur in your videos:

- Motion blur can reduce the sharpness and clarity of your videos. It can make your footage look blurry or smeared. Motion blur can also obscure important details or features in your scene.
- Motion blur can increase the rendering time and file size of your videos. It can make your video editing software work harder and slower. Motion blur can also consume more storage space and bandwidth when you export or upload your videos.
- Motion blur can cause visual artifacts or errors in your videos. It can create ghosting or double images when objects move too fast or change direction abruptly. Motion blur can also interfere with other effects or transitions in your video, such as chroma keying, masking, or dissolves.

Therefore, you should use motion blur wisely and sparingly in your videos. You should balance the amount and quality of motion blur with the purpose and style of your video. You should also test and preview your video before rendering or exporting it.
