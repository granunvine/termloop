Go2 is a type of synthesizer that has all of the controls and features available visually all at once. It is part of the Rob Papen collection of virtual instruments that offer many features and types of synthesis. I like the sound and versatility of Go2, so I started experimenting with it in different ways. However, I don't think its filter is very good, it sounds similar to the original LinPlug Cronox, which was not a very powerful synth. So I don't think Go2 is suitable for creating basslines that need a lot of depth and warmth. But I found a niche for it as a filler instrument, adding some extra texture and grit between the bassline and lead parts. These are the kinds of parts that are not very noticeable on their own, but they make a big difference to the overall sound when they are present. And Go2 is great for that purpose because it has a very different character from the virtual analog synths that I usually work with, which means it complements them rather than competes with them in the mix.

One of the features that I really like about Go2 is the morph oscillator. It allows me to blend between two different waveforms using various modes of morphing. This gives me a lot of control over the shape and timbre of the sound. I can create anything from smooth transitions to abrupt changes, depending on the mode and amount of morphing. The morph oscillator also has a sub-oscillator that can add some extra low-end or high-end to the sound. I find this useful for filling out the frequency spectrum and adding some richness to the sound.

Another feature that I enjoy using is the onboard sequencer. It is a 16-step sequencer that can generate notes and chords based on the scale and key that I choose. It also has some options for adjusting the velocity, length, slide, and swing of the notes. The sequencer is very easy and fun to work with, and it helps me come up with new ideas and melodies. Sometimes I use it to create a simple pattern and then tweak it with the morph oscillator and the filter. Other times I use it to create complex sequences that add some movement and variation to the sound.
  
Go2 also has some onboard effects that can enhance the sound further. It has a chorus effect that can add some width and depth to the sound, a flanger/phaser effect that can create some modulation and movement, and a delay/reverb effect that can create some space and ambience. The effects are very simple to use, but they can make a big difference to the sound. I usually use them sparingly, just to add some finishing touches to the sound. But sometimes I use them more creatively, to create some interesting soundscape or atmosphere.
