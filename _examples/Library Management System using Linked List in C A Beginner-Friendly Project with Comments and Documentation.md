A library management system is a software application that helps to manage the operations of a library, such as cataloging books, issuing and returning books, maintaining records of borrowers, etc. One of the data structures that can be used to implement a library management system is a linked list. A linked list is a collection of nodes that store data and a pointer to the next node. Linked lists are dynamic and flexible, and they allow for easy insertion and deletion of nodes.
 
In this article, we will show how to implement a library management system using linked list in C. We will assume that each book in the library has a unique ID, a title, an author, and a status (available or borrowed). We will also assume that each borrower has a unique ID, a name, and a list of books borrowed. We will use two linked lists: one for storing the books and one for storing the borrowers. We will also define some functions to perform the following tasks:

- Create a new book node and add it to the book list
- Create a new borrower node and add it to the borrower list
- Search for a book by ID or title
- Search for a borrower by ID or name
- Issue a book to a borrower
- Return a book from a borrower
- Display all the books in the library
- Display all the borrowers in the library

The code for the implementation is given below:
  ```c #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// Define the structure of a book node
struct book 
    int id; // Book ID
    char title[50]; // Book title
    char author[50]; // Book author
    int status; // Book status (0 for available, 1 for borrowed)
    struct book *next; // Pointer to the next book node
;

// Define the structure of a borrower node
struct borrower 
    int id; // Borrower ID
    char name[50]; // Borrower name
    struct book *books; // Pointer to the list of books borrowed by the borrower
    struct borrower *next; // Pointer to the next borrower node
;

// Define global variables for the head pointers of the book list and the borrower list
struct book *book_head = NULL;
struct borrower *borrower_head = NULL;

// Function to create a new book node and add it to the book list
void add_book(int id, char *title, char *author) 
    // Allocate memory for the new book node
    struct book *new_book = (struct book *)malloc(sizeof(struct book));
    // Assign values to the new book node
    new_book->id = id;
    strcpy(new_book->title, title);
    strcpy(new_book->author, author);
    new_book->status = 0; // Set status to available by default
    new_book->next = NULL;
    // If the book list is empty, make the new book node as the head
    if (book_head == NULL) 
        book_head = new_book;
    
    // Else, traverse to the end of the book list and append the new book node
    else 
        struct book *temp = book_head;
        while (temp->next != NULL) 
            temp = temp->next;
        
        temp->next = new_book;

// Function to create a new borrower node and add it to the borrower list
void add_borrower(int id, char *name) {
    // Allocate memory for the new borrower node
    struct borrower *new_borrower = (struct borrower *)malloc(sizeof(struct borrower));
    // Assign values to the new borrower node
    new_borrower->id = id;
    strcpy(new_borrower->name, name);
    new_borrower->books = NULL; // Set books pointer to NULL by default
    new_borrower->next = NULL;
    // If the borrower list is empty, make the new borrower node as the head
    if (borrower_head == NULL) 
        borrower_head = new_borrower;
    
    // Else, traverse to the end of the borrower list and append the new borrower node
    else {
        struct borrower *temp = borrower_head;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
