Once you have obtained a copy of Midnight Club Los Angeles Complete Edition for Xbox 360, you will need to configure Xenia to run it properly on your PC. Here are some settings that you should adjust before launching the game:
 
- Open xenia.exe and go to File > Open. Browse to the location where you saved your Midnight Club Los Angeles ISO or XEX file and select it.
- Go to Edit > Settings. Under General > System Settings, change Language from English (US) to English (UK). This will prevent some graphical glitches in the game.
